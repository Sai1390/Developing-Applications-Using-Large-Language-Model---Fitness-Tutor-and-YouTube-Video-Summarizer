Overview
In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, LLMs have emerged as essential tools that replicate and extend human language capabilities. This project explores their application in two significant areas:

Fitness Tutor: Provides users with customized fitness routines and motivational messages tailored to individual needs, regardless of age or gender. By considering user inputs, the system generates dynamic workout plans that bridge the gap between users and their fitness goals, enhancing engagement beyond typical fitness applications.

YouTube Video Summarizer: Utilizes LLMs and advanced AI tools to streamline the process of consuming video content. The application downloads audio from YouTube videos, transcribes it using Assembly AI, and delivers concise text summaries. This automation saves users time and makes it easier to digest large volumes of video information efficiently.
